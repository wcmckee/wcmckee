        "\n",
        "Thanks to everyone who participated in our State of the Union discussion this week. I've got lotsa modding to do tonight, so I'm gonna make this as brief as possible! The mods and I have discussed it, and here are the results of our talk:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) We are NOT going to implement any rules on photo quality in the sub. People felt concerned that professional, hi-res photos would be boring, and/or that we would be leaving out people who can't afford a good camera, and/or that artists here still make incredible art out of grainy, blurry, forehead-cropped, same-ole same-ole selfies. BUT! Next time I see a complaint about the quality of photos here, I am going to remind you of the Great Vote of 2014. The community has spoken, crappy photos are welcome. &lt;smacks gavel&gt;\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Starting today, you can't use the word \"gift\" or \"birthday\" in your titles anymore, so put that in yer pipe and smoke it! We're sick of your gift posts, submitters! However, artists should know that submitters are likely to give your art as gifts anyway, whether it's in the title or not. Just want you to be fully informed. :)\n",
        "\n",
        "3) The tidal wave of new posts is too much for us mods to bear - we are seeing posts that should have been removed for the title that have been up for 5-6 hours before we see and remove it. Accordingly, starting today, we'll be implementing a one-week trial in which all submissions will land in the spam filter until we go in and manually approve them. We unfortunately won't be able to check the OP for frequent posting and reposts until after it's manually approved, but still - if you see a post for the next week, you can assume it's been scanned for unclear titles, downer titles, inappropriate relationships, offering compensation, using art for occupational purposes, etc. etc. etc. :) This should cut down on the number of posts we have to remove in which an artist has already contributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Artists are no longer allowed to say \"I'm working on it.\" Those comments will be removed. They can, however, ask questions if it's relevant to impending art (\"What color are your eyes?\") and they can still leave constructive feedback on why they are passing over particular photos. Thank you, /u/BosqueBravo, for making it happen. The threads will be so clean! Eeeee!\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, this sub is amazing. I expressed some frustration that the mods have been feeling due to the sub nearly doubling in size in the space of a week - erm, did you see that we passed 50k subscribers this week? Two weeks ago, we were at 28k - and we have all received an overwhelming show of support. It's been really nice, so thank you for being here and contributing and for letting us do our strict-modding thing that we do. :)\n",
        "\n",
        "P.S. I'm getting married in six weeks. I'll be announcing this randomly and intermittently until the deed is done. You're welcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Until next time! \n",
