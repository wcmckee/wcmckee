Thanks!Reposts aren\\'t allowed. Post removed.This sub isn\\'t for making fun of people. Post removed. Also, didn\\'t I just see your face in a different post? See our rules, please.Posts pertaining to illness or injury are removed, so please repost a photo without the blind dog.&amp;gt; I shouldn\\'t point details that I especially like about a drawing?\\n\\nNo, you should definitely point out details you especially like. I would avoid comments that have a sentiment like &quot;Thanks for giving him/her freckles that aren\\'t there,&quot; and other comments of that nature that sound more like veiled criticism.</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <div id=\"body\">\\n      <ol>\\n        <h1>Could you draw me please: )</h1>\\n        <p>\\n          <img src=\"http://imgur.com/hfAicMu\">\\n        </p>\\n        <p>airforce34</p>\\n        <h1>Draw my son stepping across these logs?</h1>\\n        <p>\\n          <img src=\"http://imgur.com/wHG6k3p\">\\n        </p>\\n        <p>nyrhtak01</p>\\n        <h1>My daughter and her cousin at my sister\\'s wedding.</h1>\\n        <p>\\n          <img src=\"http://imgur.com/wMueN7X\">\\n        </p>\\n        <p>ifdorightnocandefend</p>\\n        <h1>2 of my friends and I (in the middle) at our bowling league.
